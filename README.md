# Simulation-of-Protein-Synthesis
Developed a console-based bioinformatics simulation that replicates the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA ➝ RNA ➝ Protein. The program accepts DNA sequences as input, validates them, detects start and stop codons, transcribes valid sequences to mRNA, and translates them into amino acids using genetic codon mapping.
